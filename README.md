# perm_model

The goal of the project is to develop a model for predicting compounds’ permeability. Permeability is the measure of a
molecule’s ability to cross a membrane. The body, for example, has notable membranes between the body and brain,
known as the blood–brain barrier, and between the gut and body in the intestines. These membranes help the body guard
critical regions from receiving undesirable or detrimental substances. Permeability assays such as PAMPA and Caco-2
have been developed to help measure compounds’ permeability. These screens are effective at quantifying a compound’s
permeability, but the assay is expensive labor intensive. Given a sufficient number of compounds that have been
screened, we could develop a predictive model for permeability in an attempt to potentially reduce the need for the assay.
